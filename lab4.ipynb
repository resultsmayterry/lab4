    "### II. Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "Markov Chains (MC) are powerful tools for modeling the dynamics of systems. What if we wanted to use an MC to model a certain game, evaluating different policies to compare them? We can just use MCs, but since we want a good metric to evaluate these policies, we need to consider taking different actions and recieving a reward signal for feedback. At some state $s_t$ in the MC, we can take an action $a_t$, and observe not only the next state $s_{t+1}$, but also the reward $r_t$ associated with that transition. This is how Markov Decision Processes (MDP) are formed i.e., they combine elements of control with the Markovian model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MDPs rely on the Markov Assumption:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)=P(s_{t+1}|h_t,a_t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h_t$ is the history of all states up to step $t$. Essentially, this says that we only need to know the current state and the action to predict the outcome. With this assumption, we can formulate an MDP $\\mathcal{M}:\\{\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},P,R\\}$ as a collection of a set of states, a set of actions, a probability transition function and a reward transition function respectively. \n",

We set $\\gamma<1$ in order to give higher weight to rewards that come sooner, but also this makes sure that our return $G_t$ is finite even if our policy runs for an infinite time. This way we do not have to worry about the horizon of our MDP. \n",
